        <p>My favorite hobby is coding.I like coding because it helps me make my own fun games / websites.Sometimes I look
            for games / websites but it is not what I need, coding can help me design games / websites
            for what I need.I also like coding because it is fun and inspires creativity! When starting to code at first, you may feel bored.But
            after a few more times, you start getting more creative.And before you know it, You Have Just Coded A World FAMOUS Game / Website!</p>
